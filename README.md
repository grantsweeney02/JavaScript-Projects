JavaScript Projects

These are a series of projects I am working on to develop my HTML, CSS, JavaScript skills.

1. Count-down Timer
Countdown to New Years. After New Year's 2023, it will be updated automatically for the new year's 2024. So after it counts down to zero, it will display 365 days. 

2. A quiz about me and my life.
